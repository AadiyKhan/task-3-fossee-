# Model Evaluation: StarCoder for Student Competence Analysis

## Selected Model: StarCoder

**Model Details:**
- **Parameters**: 15.5B
- **Training Data**: 1 trillion tokens from 80+ programming languages, including 35B Python tokens
- **Architecture**: Transformer-based decoder model
- **Availability**: Open source via Hugging Face Hub
- **Repository**: https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder

## Evaluation Criteria and Assessment

### 1. Code Analysis Capabilities
**Strength**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
- **Assessment**: StarCoder demonstrates exceptional ability to understand Python syntax, semantics, and code structure
- **Evidence**: Trained on massive Python codebase, can parse complex code patterns and identify logical flows
- **Educational Relevance**: Can analyze student code across all skill levels from basic syntax to advanced algorithms

### 2. Prompt Generation for Conceptual Understanding
**Strength**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
- **Assessment**: Strong capability to generate relevant prompts, though may require careful prompt engineering
- **Evidence**: Can create questions about code functionality, edge cases, and alternative implementations
- **Educational Relevance**: Generates prompts that test understanding rather than memorization
- **Limitation**: May need fine-tuning to align with specific pedagogical approaches

### 3. Misconception Detection
**Strength**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
- **Assessment**: Good at identifying common programming errors and logical inconsistencies
- **Evidence**: Can spot off-by-one errors, incorrect loop conditions, variable scope issues
- **Educational Relevance**: Helps identify where students struggle conceptually
- **Limitation**: May miss domain-specific misconceptions without additional training

### 4. Guided Learning Without Solution Revelation
**Strength**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
- **Assessment**: Moderate capability, requires careful prompt design to avoid giving away answers
- **Evidence**: Can provide hints and ask leading questions when properly prompted
- **Educational Relevance**: Supports scaffolded learning approach
- **Limitation**: Tendency to be either too helpful or too vague without fine-tuning

### 5. Computational Efficiency
**Strength**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
- **Assessment**: Resource-intensive, requiring significant hardware for deployment
- **Evidence**: 15.5B parameters demand substantial GPU memory and processing power
- **Educational Relevance**: May limit accessibility for smaller educational institutions
- **Limitation**: High infrastructure costs may restrict widespread adoption

## Testing Methodology

### Sample Code Analysis
```python
# Example student code with misconception
def find_maximum(numbers):
    max_num = 0  # Misconception: assumes all numbers are positive
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return max_num
```

**StarCoder's Analysis Capability:**
- ✅ Identifies the zero initialization issue
- ✅ Can generate prompts about edge cases (negative numbers, empty lists)
- ✅ Suggests testing with various input scenarios
- ⚠️ May need prompting to focus on the conceptual error rather than syntax

### Generated Educational Prompts Examples:
1. "What happens when your function receives a list of all negative numbers? Walk through the execution step by step."
2. "Consider the initialization of max_num. What assumptions does this make about the input data?"
3. "How might you modify the initialization to handle any possible input values?"

## Comparison with Alternative Models

## Conclusions and Recommendations

**StarCoder is a promising candidate for student competence analysis** with strong code understanding capabilities and good potential for educational prompt generation. However, its computational requirements and need for educational fine-tuning present implementation challenges.

**Key Recommendations:**
1. **Hybrid Approach**: Use StarCoder for complex analysis tasks while employing lighter models (like CodeBERT) for routine assessments
2. **Educational Fine-tuning**: Invest in creating educational datasets and fine-tuning procedures
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Develop comprehensive prompt libraries for different learning objectives
4. **Infrastructure Planning**: Consider cloud-based deployment or model serving solutions to manage computational costs

**Next Steps:**
- Pilot testing with real student code samples
- Collaboration with educators to validate prompt quality
- Investigation of smaller, education-specific model alternatives
- Development of evaluation metrics specific to educational effectiveness
