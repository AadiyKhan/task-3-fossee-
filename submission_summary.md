6. **`README.md`** - Setup instructions and project overview

## Research Highlights

### Primary Model Evaluated: StarCoder
- **Strengths**: Exceptional code understanding, open source, versatile applications
- **Limitations**: High computational requirements, needs educational fine-tuning
- **Rating**: 4/5 for educational suitability (excellent capability, practical challenges)

### Key Findings

1. **Model Suitability**: Requires deep code comprehension, conceptual understanding detection, and pedagogical awareness
2. **Testing Methodology**: Combines expert validation, student response analysis, and comparative evaluation
3. **Trade-offs**: Balance between accuracy (model sophistication), interpretability (explainability), and cost (computational resources)

### Recommendations

- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine large models (StarCoder) for complex analysis with smaller models (CodeBERT) for routine tasks
- **Educational Fine-tuning**: Invest in creating education-specific training datasets
- **Gradual Implementation**: Start with simpler models and scale up as institutional capacity grows

## Next Steps

This research provides a foundation for implementing AI-powered student competence analysis. The next phase would involve:

1. **Pilot Testing**: Deploy selected models with real student code
2. **Educator Collaboration**: Validate prompt quality with teaching professionals  
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Improve models based on classroom feedback
4. **Scale Planning**: Develop deployment strategies for educational institutions

The research demonstrates that while challenges exist, open source AI models show significant promise for enhancing programming education through intelligent competence analysis and adaptive prompt generation.
